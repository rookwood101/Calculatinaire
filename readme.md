Calculatinaire
==============
A project by me(Alex Sadler) because I feel that current calculator programs are lacking in functionality, compared to handheld ones.

Why is this?

Surely, a calculator program running on a powerful computer should be much more functional than anything that costs as little as Â£10.

Calculator companies (Casio, I'm looking at you) must really want your money.
